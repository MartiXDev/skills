## MartiX SharePoint Framework router

- Standalone-first skill package focused on SharePoint Online-first SPFx
  decisions for modern client-side customization.
- Keep host surface, SPFx version, toolchain, component choice, API clients,
  deployment, and migration guidance aligned instead of treating them as
  unrelated cleanup passes.
- Use [AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md) when the scenario crosses multiple workstreams or
  needs the longer review routes, package inventory, or maintainer cues.

## When to use this skill

- Author, review, set up, or verify SPFx web parts, extensions, Form
  Customizers, library components, toolchains, scaffolds, or compatibility
  postures for SharePoint Online.
- Design property panes, `propertiesMetadata`, React structure, theme-aware UI,
  packaging, asset hosting, or rollout strategy.
- Integrate SPFx code with SharePoint REST, PnPjs, `MSGraphClientV3`, or
  `AadHttpClient`; expose web parts in Teams or wire Viva Connections and ACE.
- Translate Script Editor, Content Editor, JSLink, UserCustomAction, or ECB-era
  customizations into supported modern client-side surfaces.
- Review SharePoint 2019 or Subscription Edition compatibility notes.

## Not for this skill

- Classic farm solutions, WSP packages, Feature Framework receivers, master
  pages, page layouts, or other server-side SharePoint Server work better
  handled by [martix-sharepoint-server](../martix-sharepoint-server/SKILL.md).
- Pure provisioning, tenant automation, or operator-run workflows better
  handled by [martix-sharepoint-pnp](../martix-sharepoint-pnp/SKILL.md).
- Generic React or TypeScript advice that is not materially shaped by SPFx
  constraints.
- Broad SharePoint governance, compliance, or tenant administration questions
  with no client-side implementation angle.

## Quick default choices

| Concern | Default | Escalate when |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Page content or configurable page experience | SPFx web part | The request is really page chrome, list commands, or list form replacement |
| Page chrome, placeholders, command bars, or list cells | SPFx extension | The request is really page content or a form experience |
| List or library new, edit, or display forms | SPFx Form Customizer | The requirement spans more than list or library form lifecycle |
| Reuse across multiple SPFx solutions | Local package or shared workspace code first | A separately deployed library component is truly needed across solutions |
| Runtime SharePoint data access | `SPHttpClient` or carefully scoped PnPjs | The task is actually provisioning-only or requires Graph or external API auth |
| Graph or Entra-secured API access | `MSGraphClientV3` or `AadHttpClient` with explicit permissions | The task depends on server-side processing or non-SPFx auth flows |
| SharePoint Server 2019 or SE target | Treat 2019-era constraints as the conservative baseline | Local validation and current docs prove a narrower or broader support envelope |

## Start with the closest route

1. Pick the closest workstream below.
2. Add the paired reference map before widening the answer.
3. Pull in [assets/host-support-matrix.json](./assets/host-support-matrix.json)
   whenever host or version support is part of the decision.
4. Open [AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md) when the scenario spans setup, component
   selection, deployment, and migration together.
